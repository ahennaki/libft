## Introduction

C programming can be challenging without access to standard functions. The libft project aims to address this by creating a library of functions that mirror those in the standard library. These functions will be prefixed with 'ft_' to distinguish them.

## Features

- **Libc Functions**: Reimplementation of standard libc functions with the 'ft_' prefix.
- **Additional Functions**: Custom functions not present in libc, enhancing functionality.
- **Linked List Operations**: Bonus functions for efficient manipulation of linked lists.
- **Consistent Naming**: All functions follow a consistent naming convention for easy identification.

## Getting Started

To use libft in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahennaki/libft.git

2. Include libft in your project:

   ```bash
   #include "libft.h"

3. Compile your project with libft:

   ```bash
   gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Ilibft your_project.c libft.a -o your_project

## Usage

For detailed usage instructions and function documentation, refer to the libft.h header file. Example programs and test cases are also included in the tests directory.
